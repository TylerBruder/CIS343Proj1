This small program will read in a file and reverse its contents. It will then write to a new file, named whatever you name it in the arguements.

To download and run the program, run a git clone [clone link]. Next, simply CD into the directory, call "./a.out [test1] [fileName]".
Note you can add your own file into the directory and replace 'test1' with your file name if you choose.
